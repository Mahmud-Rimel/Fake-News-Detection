# Fake News Detection

The motivation of this project is to differentiate between Fake news and Real news by applying Natural Language processing techniques and machine learning algorithms.

## Workflow of the study
- **Removing Punctuation** 
- **Tokenization**
- **Stopwords**
- **Stemming**
- **Feature Extraction**
- **Building machine learning classifiers**
- **Evaluation of the results**

### **Tokenization**

Tokenization is a technique to separating a piece of texts in small units. A text may contain with a huge number of words, sentences. Tokenization creates a list of words in the text. For example:  ' I am writing a markdown file.' --> ['I', 'am', 'writing','a', 'markdown','file.']

### **Stopwords**

Stopwords are words which has little value in a text/very common in a text.For example, in English language stopwords are 'I, am, is, are, he, she, my, to , for, was' etc.

### **Stemming**

Stemming is a technique to reduce the abundant of a words from text. Stemming removes the suffixes of words and return a base form of the word. 
For example :plays, playing, played -- > play

### **TF-IDF (Term Frequency - Inverse Document Frequency)**

Term frequency and inverse document frequency is vectorization technique to show the importance of an word in a text based on  frequency and weight of th word.
